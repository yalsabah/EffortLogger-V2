# EffortLogger-V2


Target Organizations
Our primary focus is on organizations engaged in agile software development. These organizations frequently encounter challenges with effort estimation in agile sprints, often leading to project delays and budget overruns. An additional point is the lack of effective tools for data-driven decision-making within agile project frameworks. A vital aspect of our solution targets ensuring the confidentiality and security of information within effort logging tools, addressing concerns around employee privacy and data protection.
The Problem
The problem we aim to address revolves around enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of agile sprint effort estimation. Our solution seeks to provide a more data-driven approach, leveraging historical information to inform future project planning. Moreover, we are committed to safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring that our system is adaptable to the evolving needs of cross-functional teams, thus supporting the dynamic nature of modern agile environments.
