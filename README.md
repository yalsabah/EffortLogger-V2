# EffortLogger-V2


Our primary focus is on organizations engaged in agile software development. These organizations frequently encounter challenges with effort estimation in agile sprints, often leading to project delays and budget overruns. An additional point is the lack of effective tools for data-driven decision-making within agile project frameworks. A vital aspect of our solution targets ensuring the confidentiality and security of information within effort logging tools, addressing concerns around employee privacy and data protection.


The problem we aim to address revolves around enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of agile sprint effort estimation. Our solution seeks to provide a more data-driven approach, leveraging historical information to inform future project planning. Moreover, we are committed to safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring that our system is adaptable to the evolving needs of cross-functional teams, thus supporting the dynamic nature of modern agile environments.


#A Proposed Solution

Solution Overview
We've envisioned a solution that combines EffortLogger V2 with the Planning Poker application, to transform agile sprint planning and effort estimation. This integrated approach aims to use historical data effectively while combining analytical and collaborative techniques and adhering to high data security and privacy requirements. Our goal is to make agile planning more exact, streamlined, and secure
Major Solution Scenarios
The primary scenarios where our solution will have an impact include improved project estimation accuracy, more rapid agile sprint planning, and effective use of historical data. We propose a system in which estimating methods are incorporated, allowing for real-time changes and a reduction in estimation differences. The streamlined planning process will be facilitated by consensus-based effort estimation and iterative planning enhancements. In addition, the usage of historical data will help in informed choices and predictive analytics, enhancing the accuracy of future project planning.
